<p>The Evelops Dance Competition System is a fully integrated system for managing your dance competition.
It will do as little as scorring a single event and as much as managing the timing and online registration for a whole dance weekender.</p>

<p>The integrated scoring system is based on relative placement. The details of this can be found here: <a href='http://www.swingdancecouncil.com/library/relativeplacement.htm' >Swing Dance Council Relative Placement System</a></p>
